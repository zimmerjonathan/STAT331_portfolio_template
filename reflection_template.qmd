[**My Grade:**]{.underline} I believe my grade equivalent to course work evidenced below to be an C.

[**Learning Objective Evidence:**]{.underline} In the code chunks below, provide code from Lab or Challenge assignments where you believe you have demonstrated proficiency with the specified learning target. Be sure to specify **where** the code came from (e.g., Lab 4 Question 2).

## Working with Data

**WD-1: I can import data from a *variety* of formats (e.g., csv, xlsx, txt, etc.).**

-   `csv`

lab 3 question 2

*I revised this section of code because I didn't load in the data using the here() function my first attempt.*

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-csv

my_data <- read.csv(here("data","teacher_evals.csv"))

```

-   `xlsx`

Practice activity 4 question 1

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-xlsx

military <- read_xlsx(here::here("data", 
                                 "gov_spending_per_capita.xlsx"), 
                      sheet = "Share of Govt. spending", 
                      skip  = 6, 
                      n_max = 192)

```

-   `txt`

Practice Activity 5

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-txt

message_data <- read_csv("https://github.com/earobinson95/stat331-calpoly/raw/master/practice-activities/data/scrambled_message.txt")

```

**WD-2: I can select necessary columns from a dataset.**

lab 3 question 5

```{r}
#| label: wd-2

teacher_evals_clean <- my_data %>%
  rename(sex = gender) %>%
  filter(no_participants >= 10) %>%
  mutate(course_id = as.character(course_id),
         teacher_id = as.character(teacher_id)) %>%
  select(course_id, teacher_id, question_no, no_participants, resp_share, 
         SET_score_avg, percent_failed_cur, academic_degree, seniority, sex)

```

**WD-3: I can filter rows from a dataframe for a *variety* of data types (e.g., numeric, integer, character, factor, date).**

-   numeric

Lab 3 question 9

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-numeric

teacher_evals_clean %>%
  group_by(course_id, teacher_id) %>%
  summarise(n_questions = n_distinct(question_no)) %>%
  filter(n_questions == 9)

```

-   character -- specifically a string (example must use functions from **stringr**)

lab 5

*I revised this code to use stringr rather than grepl*

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-string

suspects <- drivers_license %>%
  filter(str_detect(plate_number, "H42W")) %>%
  left_join(person, by = c("id" = "license_id"))

```

-   factor

Lab 3 question 12

*I revised this code because I had only selected a single row equal to the highest and lowest. Both times i correctly filtered for a factor.*

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-factor


teacher_evals_clean %>%
  filter(sex == "female", academic_degree %in% c("dr", "prof")) %>%
  group_by(teacher_id) %>%
  summarise(avg_resp_share = mean(resp_share, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_resp_share)) %>%
  filter(avg_resp_share %in% c(max(avg_resp_share),min(avg_resp_share)))


```

-   date (example must use functions from **lubridate**)

Lab 5

*I revised this code to use the ymd function from lubridate*

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-date

crime_scene <- crime_scene_report %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>%
  filter(type == "murder",
         date == ymd("20180115"),
         city == "SQL City")

```

**WD-4: I can modify existing variables and create new variables in a dataframe for a *variety* of data types (e.g., numeric, integer, character, factor, date).**

-   numeric (using `as.numeric()` is not sufficient)

Challenge 3 question 1

```{r}
#| label: wd-4-numeric

teacher_evals_compare <- teacher_evals_clean %>%
  filter(question_no == 903) %>%
  mutate(
    SET_level = if_else(SET_score_avg >= 4, "excellent", "standard"),
    sen_level = if_else(seniority <= 4, "junior", "senior")
  ) %>%
  select(course_id, SET_level, sen_level)

```

-   character -- specifically a string (example must use functions from **stringr**)

## Reproducibility

**R-1: I can create professional looking, reproducible analyses using RStudio projects, Quarto documents, and the here package.**

I've done this in the following provided assignments: Lab 2, lab 3

**R-2: I can write well documented and tidy code.**

-   Example of **ggplot2** plotting

Lab 2 question 4

```{r}
#| label: r-2-1

ggplot(data = my_data,
       mapping = aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length)) +
  facet_wrap(~ species) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Weight vs Hindfoot Length",
       x = "Weight (g)",
       y = "",
       subtitle = "Hindfoot Length (mm)")

```

-   Example of **dplyr** pipeline

lab 3 question 5

```{r}
#| label: r-2-2

teacher_evals_clean <- my_data %>%
  rename(sex = gender) %>%
  filter(no_participants >= 10) %>%
  mutate(course_id = as.character(course_id),
         teacher_id = as.character(teacher_id)) %>%
  select(course_id, 
         teacher_id, 
         question_no, 
         no_participants, 
         resp_share, 
         SET_score_avg, 
         percent_failed_cur, 
         academic_degree, 
         seniority, 
         sex)

```

-   Example of function formatting

lab 3 question 5

```{r}
#| label: r-2-3

teacher_evals_clean <- my_data %>%
  rename(sex = gender) %>%
  filter(no_participants >= 10) %>%
  mutate(course_id = as.character(course_id),
         teacher_id = as.character(teacher_id)) %>%
  select(course_id, 
         teacher_id, 
         question_no, 
         no_participants, 
         resp_share, 
         SET_score_avg, 
         percent_failed_cur, 
         academic_degree, 
         seniority, 
         sex)

```

**R-3: I can write robust programs that are resistant to changes in inputs.**

-   Example -- any context

lab 3 question 5

```{r}
#| label: r-3-example


teacher_evals_clean <- my_data %>%
  rename(sex = gender) %>%
  filter(no_participants >= 10) %>%
  mutate(course_id = as.character(course_id),
         teacher_id = as.character(teacher_id)) %>%
  select(course_id, 
         teacher_id, 
         question_no, 
         no_participants, 
         resp_share, 
         SET_score_avg, 
         percent_failed_cur, 
         academic_degree, 
         seniority, 
         sex)

```

## Data Visualization & Summarization

**DVS-1: I can create visualizations for a *variety* of variable types (e.g., numeric, character, factor, date)**

-   at least two numeric variables

lab 2 question 4

```{r}
#| label: dvs-1-num


ggplot(data = my_data,
       mapping = aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length)) +
  facet_wrap(~ species) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Weight vs Hindfoot Length",
       x = "Weight (g)",
       y = "",
       subtitle = "Hindfoot Length (mm)")

```

-   at least one numeric variable and one categorical variable

lab 2 question 8

```{r}
#| label: dvs-2-num-cat

ggplot(data = my_data,
       mapping = aes(x=species, y=weight)) +
  geom_density_r +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = species), alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Weight Across Species",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Weight (g)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

-   at least two categorical variables

lab 4 question 6

*This code was revised to connect the data pipeline and ggplot. Both times two categorical variables were correctly plotted.*

```{r}
#| label: dvs-2-cat


ca_childcare %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(mc_infant, mc_toddler, mc_preschool), 
               names_to = "age_group", 
               values_to = "median_price") %>%
  mutate(age_group = fct_recode(age_group,
                                 "Infants" = "mc_infant",
                                 "Toddlers" = "mc_toddler",
                                 "Preschoolers" = "mc_preschool")) %>%

       subtitle = "Median Price",
       x = "Study Year",
       y = "",
       color = "California Region") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(100, 500)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2008, 2018, by = 2)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))

```

-   dates (timeseries plot)

lab 4 question 6

*This code was revised to join the data pipeline and ggplot. Both times a timeseries was plot*

```{r}
#| label: dvs-2-date


ca_childcare %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(mc_infant, mc_toddler, mc_preschool), 
               names_to = "age_group", 
               values_to = "median_price") %>%
  mutate(age_group = fct_recode(age_group,
                                 "Infants" = "mc_infant",
                                 "Toddlers" = "mc_toddler",
                                 "Preschoolers" = "mc_preschool")) %>%
  mutate(age_group = fct_relevel(age_group, "Infants", "Toddlers", "Preschoolers")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = study_year, y = median_price, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ age_group, ncol = 3) +
  labs(title = "Weekly Median Price for Center-Based Childcare ($)",
       subtitle = "Median Price",
       x = "Study Year",
       y = "",
       color = "California Region") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(100, 500)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2008, 2018, by = 2)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))
```

**DVS-2: I use plot modifications to make my visualization clear to the reader.**

-   I can ensure people don't tilt their head

lab 4 question 6

*This code was revised. both times a subtitle was used rather than a y axis label to prevent heads from tilting.*

```{r}
#| label: dvs-2-1

## Revising My Thinking

<!-- How did you revise your thinking throughout the course? How did you revise your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I revised my thinking on the code examples provided in my portfolio by revisiting old problems and editing my code to better/correctly solve the question. To find examples to put in my portfolio I often had to revise problems and correctly use a tool or do something that I hadn't the first time. I had to revise my thinking and re think about a problem and how to do it in a better way. I would then carry this new found knowledge onto other problems.

<!-- For the revisions included in your Portfolio, to help me understand the nature of your revisions, please denote somehow the feedback I provided you (e.g., boldface, italics, colored text) before your revisions. -->

Code that had been revised is noted with a message in italics

## Extending My Thinking

<!-- How did you extended your thinking throughout the course? How did you extend your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I extended my thinking throughout the course by pushing myself to complete problems. When completeing hard problems, I would think them through before jumping directly into coding. I extended my thinking on code examples provided in my portfolio by having to revist old problems and correct them. I would then incorporate what i learned into future assignments and problems.

## Peer Support & Collaboration

<!-- Include an image or a description of feedback you gave that you are proud of (either in a peer review or in Discord). -->

"Code looks really good. It is tidy and efficient. Your spacing and use of white space is good and consistent. The only place where I think you can improve is sometimes you put one space and other times you put two spaces between the end of a line of code and the pipe operator."

<!-- Include a description of how you grew as a collaborator through the weekly pair programming activities.   -->

I grew as a collaborator by working together with my partners during practice activities. I had never partner programmed before so I learned how to effectively communicate with others. When I first collaborated with a partner it was a bit awkward, but now when working together with someone I'm able to complete assignments with ease. I am always patient and respectful when collaborating. I make an effort to follow coder and developer roles by using excellent communication and discussing new ideas.
